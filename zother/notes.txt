--------- Backlog:

Housekeeping:
    x Rename the code to HectorTools and upload to new repo
    x Move each tool into its file
    x To keep build simpler move it into a directory of its own
    - Add templates
    x Add fmt.Sprintf
    - Flags will have its own separate file and help function



Low priority -- Not immediate:
    - Include older stuff that is already created to this ---
        - API search utility
        - Integrate hector API vs JSON vs DB Tests

    - Tests for the important functions (relevant ones)

    - Add a simple web interface :
        - Show current server JSON files available (use as base code the already implemented API search code -- it has web server)
        - Show config.json for various instances

    Health Checks interface(On the same UI):
        - Status of target tools (cassandra, hector, hive(?), hadoop(?))
        - What can you take from ZooGuard(?)
